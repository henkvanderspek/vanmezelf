  "about": [
    "I enjoy creating minimalistic digital products which improve our lives. Somewhere between product design and implementation I feel most at home. Problem solving is my second nature, zooming in or out whenever that's needed, never losing sight of users and stakeholders.",
    "After dropping out of high school I started working at the age of 18 in administrative roles, mainly because I was a late bloomer and felt out of place in the education system with an abundance of creativity and somewhat stubborn intuition. Once I had to work with computers I was hooked and started learning programming at home, never looking back.",
    "After 24 years my work still doesn't feel like work to me. You can find me behind my laptop a lot, creating things and studying adjacent areas like design and 3D software. If I really want to disconnect I enjoy movies, photography and drawing on actual paper with color pencils."
